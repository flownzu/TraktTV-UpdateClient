# TraktTV-UpdateClient

A simple trakt.tv Desktop Client that enables you to update your watched shows more efficiently.

Working List:

Add/Remove episodes from your watched list.

Add ratings to watched shows.

Search for new shows to add to your watched list.

To Do List:

Enable VLC compatibility -> the Client will automatically update your watched list with episodes you watch with VLC ~~either~~ by
communicating with the VLC TCP Interface ~~or straight up initializing VLC instances with VLC.DotNet...I haven't decided yet~~.

**Will definitely work with the dodgy TCP interface of VLC since my dream of using VLC.DotNet got crushed by not being able to toggle fullscreen video and not being able to capture mouse events when the video is playing. I will not remove it from this project in case this stuff gets fixed (I certainly tried but couldn't)**
