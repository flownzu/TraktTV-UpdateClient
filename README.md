## A simple trakt.tv Desktop Client that enables you to update your watched shows more efficiently.

  - **There will probably be episodes that will not get recognized - if this happens please [contact me](mailto:florian.jaeckel@gmx.net)  or open an issue with the filename**
  
### To Do List:

- [ ] Add media library to settings so the user can set up folders the program should check for episodes

- [ ] In addition to this add buttons to directly watch an episode that the program found in your media library

#### **NOTE: This program will not help you obtain illegal copies of TV-Show episodes. I strongly recommend getting Netflix/Amazon Prime/whatever streaming platform is available in your country.**

#### **Credits to the show posters goes to the [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API and the [Fanart.TV](https://fanart.tv/) API.**
