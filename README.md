# TraktTV-UpdateClient

##A simple trakt.tv Desktop Client that enables you to update your watched shows more efficiently.

###Working List:

- Add/Remove episodes from your watched list.

- Add ratings to watched shows.

- Search for new shows to add to your watched list.

- VLC Media Player connectivity

  - Connecting and re-connecting to VLC. 

  - Recognizing the episode that is played and marking it as watched when a certain play percent is reached.

  - **This is still in early development so your episodes might not get recognized - if this happens please [contact me](mailto:florian.jaeckel@gmx.net) with the path to the episode file**
  
###To Do List:

- [ ] General code clean-up and optimizations

- [ ] Probably a lot of other stuff that I cannot think of at the moment

####**NOTE: This program will not help you obtain illegal copies of TV-Show episodes. I strongly recommend getting Netflix/Amazon Prime/whatever streaming platform is available in your country.**
